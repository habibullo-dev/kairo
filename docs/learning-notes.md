# Learning Notes

Per-task design notes for an advanced engineer new to agent architectures.
Each entry captures the *non-obvious* decisions and their rationale.

## Task 1 — Scaffold

- **src layout (`src/jarvis/`), not flat.** With a flat layout, `import jarvis`
  can accidentally resolve to the source tree in the CWD instead of the installed
  package, so tests can pass against uninstalled/stale code. The src layout forces
  an install step (`uv sync` installs editable), guaranteeing tests exercise the
  package as it will actually ship.
- **Pinned Python 3.13 while the system runs 3.14.** uv fetches a managed 3.13
  interpreter so the project doesn't depend on whatever the machine has. 3.13 has
  the broadest binary-wheel coverage; several C-extension deps we'll add later
  (lxml via trafilatura, numpy) may lack 3.14 wheels and would otherwise compile
  from source. `requires-python = ">=3.12"` keeps the floor at the plan's target.
- **Dependencies added per-task, not all upfront.** Runtime deps enter via
  `uv add` when their task needs them, so each commit ties a dependency to the
  reason it exists. Only dev tooling (ruff, pytest, pytest-asyncio) is declared now.
- **`asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pytest.** The agent core is async; auto mode lets
  `async def test_*` run without decorating every test, keeping the loop's tests
  readable.
- **Console script points at `jarvis.__main__:main`.** One entry function backs
  both `python -m jarvis` and the `jarvis` command, so there's a single place the
  REPL gets wired in at task 8.
